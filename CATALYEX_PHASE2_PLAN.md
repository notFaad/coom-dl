# Catalyex Engine - Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Current Status: Phase 1 ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### What We Have Accomplished:
- ‚úÖ Created basic Catalyex engine structure 
- ‚úÖ Integrated with main.dart engine selection system
- ‚úÖ Added Catalyex to settings dropdown
- ‚úÖ All files compile successfully 
- ‚úÖ App runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Legacy compatibility maintained

### Files Created in Phase 1:
1. `lib/view-models/Catalyex_engine.dart` - Main engine class
2. `lib/downloader/catalyex_core.dart` - Core download logic
3. `lib/services/catalyex_config.dart` - Configuration system
4. `lib/crawlers/catalyex_crawler.dart` - Advanced crawler
5. Updated `main.dart` with engine selection logic
6. Updated `lib/pages/settingsPage.dart` with dropdown
